      In over two years of slinging code, I have gained proficiencies in
      languages such as JavaScript, HTML5, PHP7, and CSS3. I have had the
      fortune of working with React, React Native, Redux, Backbone, jQuery,
      Material UI, Moment, Anime.js, SCSS, and some Three.js, as well as various
      other libraries and frameworks. In addition, I have acquired other
      miscellaneous superpowers including but not limited to API/RESTful
      Architecture, SVG Animation, MySQL, MongoDB, Git, JIRA, Chrome
      Applications, XCode, Android Studio, Sketch, Agile Web Development, and
      development team management.
